## Problem statement

Software development is a collaborative endeavor, yet existing task management systems do not encourage participation from outsiders. Even the simple act of reporting a bug is more difficult than necessary, as each project uses it's own task management system. 

Solution: A task management system built on an open, social-networking platform that enables full participation through a simple text-based protocol.
